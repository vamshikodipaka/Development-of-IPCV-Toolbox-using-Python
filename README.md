# Development-of-IP-and-CV-Toolbox-using-Python
Computer Vision Toolbox makes the Vision Researcher's life easier. It can be effective in terms of Commercial use. 
OpenCV is the open source programming tool-kit available online for free.
Hence, we as CV Researchers, find it necessary to Develop a Toolbox which can be effective for IPCV operations.

Tools: IP Tooks, Feature Extraction, Camera Calibration, Camera I-V Capture, Face Detection and Recognition
